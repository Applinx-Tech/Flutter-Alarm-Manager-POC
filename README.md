# Flutter Alarm Manager POC

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust background alarm scheduling system in a Flutter application. It utilizes method channels to communicate with native Android code, Jetpack Compose for the alarm notification UI, and a custom notification service for managing high-priority alarm notifications.

### Key Features

- Schedule alarms that run in the background.
- Handle notification permissions.
- Use method channels for native code integration.
- Leverage Jetpack Compose for modern Android UI.
- Implement a persistent alarm system that works even when the app is closed.
- Custom notification service for creating and managing high-priority alarm notifications.

## Project Structure

### Flutter (Dart) Side

- `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the Flutter application.
- `lib/alarm_manager_screen.dart`: The main screen for scheduling alarms.
- `lib/alarm_actions_screen.dart`: A screen to view and manage scheduled alarms.
- `lib/utils/alarm_method_channel.dart`: Dart side of the method channel for communicating with native Android code.

### Native Android (Kotlin) Side

- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../MainActivity.kt`: Main activity for the Flutter app, handles method channel communication.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../AlarmActivity.kt`: Activity for displaying and handling alarms using Jetpack Compose.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../alarmScheduler/AlarmScheduler.kt`: Interface for alarm scheduling.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../alarmScheduler/AlarmSchedulerImpl.kt`: Implementation of the alarm scheduling system.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../model/AlarmItem.kt`: Data model for alarm items.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../AlarmNotificationService.kt`: Interface for the alarm notification service.
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../AlarmNotificationServiceImpl.kt`: Implementation of the alarm notification service.

## Key Components

### `MainActivity`
Handles Flutter-native method channel communication. This is the entry point for all native-side interactions from Flutter.

### `AlarmActivity`
Displays and handles the alarm UI using Jetpack Compose. This is where the user interacts with the alarm (snooze, accept, etc.).

### `AlarmNotificationService`
Responsible for creating and managing high-priority notifications for alarms. It ensures that alarm notifications are persistent, even on the lock screen.

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Notification Channel Creation**: Creates a high-importance channel for alarms. Sets channel properties to bypass "Do Not Disturb," show on the lock screen, and enable lights and vibration.
  
- **Showing Notifications**: Creates a full-screen intent that launches the `AlarmActivity`. Builds a high-priority notification with a full-screen intent. The notification is ongoing and non-cancelable to ensure it persists until user interaction.
  
- **Cancelling Notifications**: Cancels a notification by its ID when alarms are dismissed or snoozed.

## Alarm Scheduler

The `AlarmScheduler` interface and its implementation, `AlarmSchedulerImpl`, provide a simple and effective way to schedule and cancel alarms in an Android app.

### Key Responsibilities:

- **Scheduling Alarms**: The `AlarmScheduler` is responsible for scheduling alarms to trigger at a specific time. It ensures that the necessary system components, such as `AlarmManager`, are used correctly to wake the device and trigger the alarm on time.

- **Handling Exact Timings**: The scheduler is designed to handle precise alarm timings using Android's `AlarmManager.setExact()` method, which is suitable for alarms requiring exact triggers.

- **Canceling Alarms**: The `AlarmScheduler` also provides functionality to cancel scheduled alarms. It ensures that any pending intents related to the alarm are properly canceled, preventing unnecessary alarms from firing.

- **Managing Alarm Intents**: The `AlarmScheduler` is responsible for creating and managing `PendingIntent` objects that represent the scheduled alarms. These intents are used by the `AlarmManager` to trigger the alarm at the specified time.

- **Ensuring Alarm Persistence**: The scheduler ensures that alarms persist even if the app is closed or the device is restarted (when configured with `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`).

## AlarmReceiver



The `AlarmReceiver` is a crucial component in the alarm management system. It extends `BroadcastReceiver`, enabling the app to respond to system-wide broadcast events, specifically alarms that are triggered by the `AlarmManager`.

### Key Responsibilities

 **Receiving Broadcasts:**
   - The primary role of `AlarmReceiver` is to listen for broadcasts triggered when an alarm goes off, even if the app is in the background or closed.
   - It receives `Intents` with alarm details such as the `ALARM_ID` and the `ALARM_MESSAGE`.

**Handling the Alarm:**
   - Once the alarm is received, it extracts the `ALARM_ID` and `ALARM_MESSAGE` from the `Intent`. If no values are provided, defaults are used (`-1` for `ALARM_ID` and `"Alarm!"` for the message).
   - It then creates an `AlarmItem` object to represent the triggered alarm.

**Displaying Notifications:**
   - After receiving the alarm, the receiver creates an instance of `AlarmNotificationService` and invokes its `showNotification` method, which displays a notification to the user about the alarm.

## Alarm Notification Flow


### 1. **Alarm Set from Flutter**
   - The alarm is initially scheduled from the Flutter side using a **Method Channel**.
   - Flutter sends a command to the native Android layer to schedule the alarm using the `AlarmScheduler`.

### 2. **Alarm Trigger and Notification Creation**
   - When the scheduled time arrives, the alarm triggers, and the `AlarmReceiver` captures the broadcast.
   - The receiver then creates an alarm notification via `AlarmNotificationService`, which shows a high-priority, full-screen notification on the device.
   - The notification appears even if the device is locked.

### 3. **User Interaction with the Alarm**
   - When the user interacts with the notification (e.g., accepting or snoozing), the `AlarmActivity` is launched.
   - Inside `AlarmActivity`, the notification content is displayed via a Jetpack Compose `AlarmScreen` interface.
   - The user can either **accept** or **snooze** the alarm, and these actions are captured within the `AlarmActivity`.

### 4. **Handling Accept or Snooze Action**
   - Based on the user's action:
     - **Accept**: The `alarmAccepted` method is invoked via the Method Channel, and the alarm is marked as accepted.
     - **Snooze**: The `alarmSnoozed` method is called, which reschedules the alarm for a later time using the `AlarmScheduler`.
   - In both cases, the notification is cancelled after the action is completed.

### 5. **Sending Action Back to Flutter**
   - After the user selects either **accept** or **snooze**, the result of the action is sent back to the Flutter layer through the Method Channel.
   - The Method Channel passes the action result (accept or snooze) back to Flutter, where it can be processed for further logic.

### 6. **Storing the Action in Local Storage (Hive DB)**
   - Once the action result is received in Flutter, it is stored locally in the **Hive DB**.
   - Hive is used to store key details like:
     - Whether the alarm was accepted or snoozed.
     - Timestamps of the actions for future reference or history tracking.
   - This ensures that the user's interaction with the alarm is saved persistently, even if the app was closed or in a killed state when the alarm was triggered.

### Key Points:
   - **Persistent Storage**: Using Hive for local storage ensures that even in cases where the app was closed, the alarm actions are reliably saved.
   - **Flutter-Android Communication**: The **Method Channel** serves as the bridge for communication between the Flutter and native Android sides, ensuring seamless action handling and data transmission.
   - **State Handling**: The system handles alarms gracefully, whether the app is in a running state or was previously killed, ensuring that alarms work in all scenarios.
